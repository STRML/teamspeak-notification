Using TeamSpeak as your office communication channel can be difficult-- especially
if you don't have your headphones on.

This application will watch for incoming messages in Teamspeak and, should you
be in a different window, display a notification to let you know that you
recieved a message.

## Requirements

 - PyGTK
 - teamspeak3

## Use

You can either run the program directly like:

    python teamspeak_notify.py &

Or add it to your automatically started applications.
